In the workshop, I learned some new aspects about computer programming. One thing I picked up was how to use command line arguments in C++ programs. It's like giving instructions to your program when you run it from the command line. This helped me open different files in my program based on what I typed in the command line.
Another crucial topic covered was different types of linkages. I gained an understanding of how to access variables defined in one module from a different module, which is valuable when working with complex programs that require data sharing across different parts.
Additionally, I delved into the concept of declaring local variables with a long lifespan. These variables remain in memory throughout the entire duration of the program, ensuring they do not go out of scope until the program terminates.
Lastly, I went over some stuff I had learned before, such as dynamically allocating memory for strings of unknown length. This helps make sure your program runs smoothly when dealing with different amounts of text. Overall, the workshop made me better at programming and understanding important programming ideas.
